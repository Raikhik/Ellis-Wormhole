# Ellis-Wormhole
Ellis's wormhole is the simplest traversable wormhole.
Here the geometry of the spacetime and the energy momentum tensor for the spacetime of the same has been worked out.
Then we look into different energy conditions.
Then we show how this spacetime violates averaged null energy condition(ANEC).
